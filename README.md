# EPM Control Board

This repository contains the design files for the EPM (Electric Permanent Magnet) Control Board, designed for controlling 8 electric permanent magnet modules. The board is optimized for compact, low-power applications, enabling precise control of EPM states for various configurations.

## Overview

The EPM Control Board is a lightweight (7.1g) PCB designed to manage the state and current direction of 8 EPM units. Key hardware components include:

- **8 H-bridge drivers** (AS4950, ASSEMSTAR Technology) for individual EPM control.
- **180ÂµF capacitor bank** for rapid EPM switching.
- **DC/DC converter** (XL6008E1, XLSEMI Technology) to step up 3.7V battery voltage to 30V.
- **ESP32-S3R8 microcontroller** (waveshare ESP32-S3-Tiny) for control logic and communication.

The design is compatible with the Crazyflie flight control system and supports modular integration for coordinated operations.
